# Events Module

The **Events module** provides functionality for listening to events emitted by Quantova contracts and Quantova nodes. It enables the SDK to react to blockchain events, such as contract method executions or changes in blockchain state, and trigger appropriate actions.

## Purpose

The Events module enables real-time interaction with the Quantova blockchain by allowing the SDK to listen to specific events. It is crucial for creating applications that need to react to blockchain changes as they occur, such as monitoring contract interactions or token transfers.
