# Contract Module

The **Contract module** provides functionality for interacting with Quantova smart contracts. It includes methods for calling contract functions, encoding/decoding contract ABI data, listening for events, and managing contract-related tasks such as state mutability.

## Purpose

- **Interact with smart contracts**: Call contract functions to change state or retrieve data.
- **ABI encoding/decoding**: Ensure the correct format for contract interaction.
- **Event listening**: Subscribe to events emitted by contracts.
- **State mutability checks**: Determine if contract methods are payable, view, or pure.

This module is crucial for enabling communication with Quantova smart contracts, making it easier to interact with the blockchain in a standardized way.
