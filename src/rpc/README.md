# RPC Module

The **RPC module** is responsible for handling communication with Quantova nodes using the **JSON-RPC** protocol. It provides methods for interacting with Quantova nodes, sending RPC requests, and handling responses. This module serves as the core interface for querying blockchain data and performing operations like fetching block data, sending transactions, and interacting with smart contracts.

## Purpose

The RPC module enables communication with Quantova nodes, making it essential for querying blockchain data, sending transactions, and interacting with smart contracts. By abstracting the RPC requests, the module provides a simple interface for interacting with the Quantova network.
